		 <ol>
			<li> <p> To make soft, tender and airy cottage cheese cookies, you will need cottage cheese, butter, sugar, vanilla sugar, flour, <br/>
			a little salt and baking powder.Cottage cheese should be taken of medium humidity, of any fat content, you can use <br/>
			paste-like cottage cheese. Both white and brown sugar are suitable.The latter will color the cookies a little and give <br/>
			a light caramel taste.It is better to take vanilla sugar natural with ground vanilla bean, it can be replaced with vanilla <br/>
			essence or extract. It is advisable not to use chemical vanillin, its aroma is different from the delicate rich aroma <br/>
			of natural vanilla. Instead of vanilla, you can put cinnamon, 0.5 tsp. will be enough.<br/>
			Butter should be soft, at room temperature, so it should be taken out of the refrigerator in advance. </p>
			</li> 
			<li><p>Put the cottage cheese in a large bowl, add softened butter, sugar, vanilla sugar and a pinch of salt.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>Mix everything well and blend until smooth. If you don't have a blender, then you can rub the mass through a sieve or <br/>
			use paste-like cottage cheese and mix all the ingredients thoroughly with a fork or whisk.<br/>
			You can also take cottage cheese with small grains, in this case small grains will be found in the cookies,<br/>
			but this is not critical at all. Cottage cheese cookies will still turn out to be delicious, soft, tender and airy.
			</p>
			</li>
			
			<li><p>Sift the flour together with baking powder into a separate bowl and add to the curd mass in parts. You may need more or <br/>
			less flour, depending on its quality (dryness, grinding, variety, etc.) and the moisture content of the cottage cheese.
			</p>	
			</li>
			<li><p>First, you should knead the dough with a spatula or culinary scraper, and then knead with your hands.
			</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>The dough should be soft, tender, while holding its shape well and not sticking to your hands. You should not knead it for <br/>
			a long time, otherwise the gluten in the flour will make the cookies hard. Wrap the dough in cling film or put it in a bag and put <br/>
			it in the refrigerator for half an hour to stabilize.The softened butter will harden, and it will be easier to work with the dough. <br/>
			</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>Then remove the dough from the refrigerator, put it on a board dusted with flour or a countertop and roll out into a layer 3 - 5 mm thick. <br/>
			Using molds or any glass, cut out the cookie blanks. You can cut the rolled out layer of dough with a knife into squares or rhombuses.<br>
		You can form cookies in another way. Make a sausage from the dough, cut into pieces, and then roll into small balls and flatten slightly.
			</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>Put the cookies on a baking sheet covered with parchment and bake in an oven preheated to 180 degrees for about 20 minutes <br/>
			until lightly golden. When baking cookies, you need to focus on the features of your oven and look after them so that they do not burn. <br/>
			In the oven, the cookies will rise about three times.
			</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>Remove the cottage cheese cookies from the oven and cool.
			</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p> Serve soft, tender and airy cottage cheese cookies with tea, coffee or milk. When serving, you can sprinkle with powdered sugar.<br/>

			So, in order for cottage cheese cookies to be soft and airy, you need to follow the following rules. <br/>
			
			<ul> 
				<li>Do not knead the dough for too long, do not clog it with flour, but at the same time add enough flour so that the dough <br/>
				holds its shape well.</li>
				<li>Before forming cookies, the dough must be cooled well.</li>
				<li>Roll out the dough into a layer 3 - 5 mm thick, not thinner.</li>
				<li>Do not overcook the cookies in the oven, otherwise they may be dry.</li>
			</ul>
			<br/>
			These simple rules will help you bake soft and airy cottage cheese cookies. Have a delicious pastry!</p>
			</li>
